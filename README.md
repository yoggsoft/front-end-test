# Front End Test

## Tasks

- [X] Drag & Drop functionality.
- [X] Right-click context menu.
- [ ] Modals for item details and edits.
- [X] Data updates dynamically based on user actions.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**Task Description**:

Create a simple **planning screen** that includes the following features:

1. **Drag & Drop Functionality**:
    - Allow users to drag and drop items between different days & users.
2. **Right-Click Context Menu**:
    - Enable a right-click feature on items to open a context menu with at least two actions (e.g., Edit and Delete).
3. **Modals**:
    - Include modals triggered by user interactions (e.g., clicking a button or selecting an option in the context menu).
    - The modal should display detailed information about the selected item and allow edits.
4. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
    - Use **fake data** to populate the planning screen dynamically (no need for a backend).
    - Ensure data updates in real-time when an item is dragged, dropped, or modified.
